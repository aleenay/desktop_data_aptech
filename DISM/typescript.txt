-TS is enhanced version of javascript
-we could say superset of javascript
-Typescript is building on javascript
-TS is not a new language . this is just add some new features

--but TS can not run on the browser directly 
--so what is the benefit of it ? if we can not run it on brower

===Typescript benefit 
-Check error on compile time.
-Add type like string number boot etc
-we can add object oriented way withh TS 
-code is well managed
