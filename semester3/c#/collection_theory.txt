Collections in C# Programing

-> A collection is a set of related data that may not nesscessary
belong to the same data type that can be set or modified dynamically 
at run time
-> In other words, Collection is dynamic array.
	==Its length can increase on runtime. AUTO RESIZING
->Normal Array Length is fixed , Its means we cannot the change
the length after declaring an array
-> Array.Resize()
-> Resize method of an array destroys old array and create a new 
array with new length 

We have two kinds of collections
=====================
Non Generic Aesi Classes jo ksi bh data type k data ko Store krleti hain 

1.Non-Generic collections (old)
-Stack,ArrayList ,hashtable,SortedList etc
-if we use non generic above classes thn we use system namespace 	
System.Collections namespace have non-generic 

=====================
generic collections only store same data type data
2.Generic Collection (new)
-List<T>, LinkedList<T>, Queue<T>,SortedList<K,V> ,Dictonary<K,V>
-System.Collections.Generic namespace have generic collections.
	
Array : It is a collection of homogeneous elements 
Homogeneous elements means Same Data type 
Collections: It is a collection of heterogeneous elements
heterogenous means different Data type 
Collections ki Non generic collections main ksi bh type ka data 
daal skty hain
