Encapsulation 
-------------
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data into a single unit.
It collects data members and member functions into a single unit
called class. The purpose of encapsulation is to prevent alteration
of data from outside.


Inheritance
-(taking) the properties of one class into another is called inheritance
-The existing class is called a base class, and the inherited class is called a derived or inherited class. 
--types of inheritance
1.Single inheritance
	Class A{
	//Base class
	}
	Class B : A {
	//derived class
	}
2.Hierarchical inheritance
This is the type of inheritance in which there are multiple classes derived from one base class
	Class A{
	//Base class
	}
	Class B : A {
	//derived class
	}
	Class C : A {
	//derived class
	}
3.Multilevel inheritance
When one class is derived from another, this type of inheritance is called multilevel inheritance.
	Class A{
	//Base class
	}
	Class B : A {
	//derived class
	}
	Class C : B {
	//derived class
	}
4.Multiple inheritances using Interfaces
	interface A
	{
	
	}
	interface B
	{
	
	}
	class C : A,B {

	}

Polymorphism
------------
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
For example, 
think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals
could be Cats Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound
