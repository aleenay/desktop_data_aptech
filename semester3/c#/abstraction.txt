=>Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain
details and showing only essential information to 
the user.
=>Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be 
used to create objects (to access it, it must be 
inherited from another class).
=>Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract 
class, and it does not have a body. 
The body is provided by the derived class 
(inherited from).
// Abstract class
    abstract class Animal
    {
        // Abstract method (does not have a body)
        public abstract void animalSound();
        // Regular method
        public void sleep()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Zzz");
        }
    }
    class dog : Animal
    {
        public override void animalSound()
        {
            // The body of animalSound() is provided here
            Console.WriteLine("The dog");
        }
    }

            dog obj = new dog();  // Create a Pig object
            obj.animalSound();
            obj.sleep();
